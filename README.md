to get started with the project,ensure you have setup and activated a virtual environment, guides on that [here](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

clone the repository via the command

```
$ git clone https://github.com/E-wave112/eshop.git
```
install the dependencies

```

then you run migrations,create an admin superuser and you are good to modify any of the project or app's name !
